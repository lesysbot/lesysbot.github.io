How to actually use LeSysBot once it's installed.

Everything here works the same whether you're in a terminal, in Telegram, or in
Discord. The examples use the terminal because it needs no setup.

---

## Starting a chat

```bash
lesysbot --provider cli
```

```
LeSysBot — local AI assistant with tools
Type a message to chat, or use /commands directly. Type 'exit' to quit.

You:
```

> **`lesysbot` on its own does something different** — it prints health and
> metrics (backend, tools, service, [control panel](management-ui.md), Grafana)
> and exits. To chat, use `lesysbot --provider cli`.

Already running as a Telegram or Discord service? A terminal chat runs happily
alongside it, with its own separate conversation.

## Two ways to ask for something

This is the one thing worth understanding well.

| | **Ask in words** | **Run it directly** (`/…`) |
|---|---|---|
| Looks like | `what's my disk usage on /?` | `/disk_usage path=/` |
| Who decides | the model picks a tool | nothing to decide — it just runs |
| Needs a model running | yes | **no** |
| Speed | as fast as your model | instant |
| Good for | questions, vague requests, several steps at once | a tool you already know, quick checks, when the model is down |

Both reach exactly the same tools. They're two doors into the same room.

---

## Asking in words

Type a sentence and press Enter.

```
You: what operating system is this machine running?
Bot: Linux 6.8.0.

You: and how much free space is on / ?
Bot: The root filesystem has 143 GB free out of 980 GB — 80% used.
```

Notice the second question didn't repeat any context. LeSysBot remembers the
conversation, so follow-ups work.

While it thinks you'll see a **`Thinking…`** spinner, switching to
**`Running <tool>…`** when it uses one. The reply streams in and renders as
proper Markdown — headings, **bold**, lists and `code` show as formatting rather
than raw symbols. If your model exposes its reasoning, that appears dimmed above
the answer.

Background log lines stay out of your way (they go to a file). Add `-v` if you
want to watch them.

---

## Running a tool directly

Anything starting with `/` runs a tool immediately, without the model.

**Pass arguments in order:**

```
You: /disk_usage /
You: /fetch_url https://example.com
```

**Or by name, in any order** — clearer when there are several:

```
You: /disk_usage path=/tmp
You: /search query="weekly report" folder=/docs
```

Quote anything containing spaces.

**Forget an argument** and it shows you what it wanted:

```
You: /disk_usage
Missing required parameter(s): path

Usage: /disk_usage <path>
  Check how much free disk space is available at a given path
```

**Mistype a name** and it points you at `/help`.

In `/help` output, `<angle brackets>` mean required and `[square brackets]` mean
optional.

> Direct calls don't go into your conversation history — they're one-shot and
> stateless, which is exactly why they still work when no model is running.

### In Telegram and Discord, the menu does the typing

You don't have to remember tool names on either platform: LeSysBot registers
every tool with the platform itself, so they show up in the client's command
menu.

- **Telegram** — type `/` and the menu lists every tool with its description.
  Pick one, then type the arguments as above.
- **Discord** — type `/` and pick the tool from the picker. Discord then gives
  you a **labelled field per parameter**, so you don't type `key=value` at all;
  required fields are marked and numbers only accept numbers.

Both are just a nicer way in — they run the same tool, without the model, and
typing the command out by hand keeps working.

> **The menu is built when the bot starts.** Install a tool (or run
> `lesysbot tools enable`) and it works as a typed command immediately, but it
> joins the menu on the next restart — the platforms rate-limit command updates,
> so LeSysBot registers once rather than on every change. Tools that are
> disabled, or unavailable on this machine, are left out of the menu.

---

## Built-in commands

Handled by LeSysBot itself, in every chat platform:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/help` *(or `/tools`)* | List every tool, with its parameters |
| `/clear` | Forget the conversation and start fresh |
| `/history` | Show what it currently remembers |
| `exit` / `quit` / `q` | Leave a terminal session |
| `Ctrl+C` | Force-quit a terminal session |

---

## When it asks permission

Some tools require approval before they run — anything that deletes, reboots, or
powers off. When the *model* decides to use one, you get asked first:

```
⚠ Confirmation required
  Tool : power_off
  This will power off the machine in 1 minute — are you sure?
Proceed? [y/n] (n):
```

`y` runs it; anything else cancels. In Telegram and Discord this arrives as
✅/❌ buttons (Telegram's expire after two minutes, Discord's after five).

> **Typing `/power_off` yourself skips the prompt.** You already decided. The
> confirmation exists to catch the *model* acting on your behalf, not to
> second-guess you.

---

## Conversation memory

- Each user gets their own history, seeded with the system prompt from your
  config.
- Only word-based messages and replies are kept — `/` commands aren't.
- Old messages are dropped once you pass `agent.max_history` (default 50). The
  system prompt always stays.
- `/history` shows what's remembered; `/clear` wipes it.

Tune the limit in [Settings](configuration.md).

---

## Changing the model for one session

No need to edit anything:

```bash
lesysbot --provider cli --model qwen3.5                        # a different local model
lesysbot --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1 --model gpt-4o   # talk to OpenAI instead
LESYSBOT_AGENT__MAX_HISTORY=100 lesysbot run                   # any setting, via the environment
```

Command-line flags win over environment variables, which win over your config
file. Full list: [Settings](configuration.md).

---

## Turning tools on and off

From any terminal, whether or not the bot is running:

```bash
lesysbot list                # everything installed, with its status
lesysbot info gpu_temp       # what it takes, where it came from
lesysbot disable gpu_temp    # hide it from the model; /gpu_temp refuses too
lesysbot enable gpu_temp     # back on
lesysbot remove gpu_temp     # delete it (asks first)
lesysbot install owner/repo  # add tools from GitHub
```

**Enabling and disabling applies within a second** to a running bot — no restart.
**Removing** deletes the tool's whole folder, including any sibling tools defined
alongside it; those are listed before you confirm.

You can do all of this from the [control panel](management-ui.md) too, if you'd
rather click.

Installing is covered properly in [Install tools](installing-tools.md).

---

## Where things are written

```
~/.lesysbot/logs/lesysbot.log     what the program did
~/.lesysbot/logs/traces.jsonl     one JSON line per message: which tools ran, how long
```

(For a source checkout with its own `config.yaml`, they're next to that instead.)

Both rotate daily. Set either to `null` in your config to switch it off. Tokens
and API keys are stripped before anything is written.

## Something not working?

See **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)** — it covers the model being
unreachable, tools not showing up, service problems, and Telegram/Discord setup
issues.
