title: Run as a service
description: Background operation, starting at boot, and where to find the logs — on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

If you reach your bot from Telegram or Slack, it needs to be running all the
time. This page covers that: keeping it alive in the background, starting it at
boot, and finding the logs when something's off.

Installing LeSysBot itself is in [Getting started](getting-started.md).

---

## You may already have one

If you picked **Telegram or Slack** in the setup wizard, a background service was
installed for you — systemd on Linux, launchd on macOS, Task Scheduler on
Windows. It runs from `~/.lesysbot`, restarts itself if it crashes, and starts on
boot if you asked for that.

If you picked **Terminal only**, there's no service, and that's correct: a
terminal chat is something you start when you want it.

The day-to-day rhythm is two commands:

```bash
$EDITOR ~/.lesysbot/config.yaml       # change something
systemctl --user restart lesysbot     # apply it (Linux — see the table below)
```

---

## Controlling it

**Linux (systemd)**

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Is it running? | `systemctl --user status lesysbot` |
| Start / stop | `systemctl --user start lesysbot` / `stop lesysbot` |
| Apply config changes | `systemctl --user restart lesysbot` |
| Start at login, or not | `systemctl --user enable lesysbot` / `disable lesysbot` |
| Remove it | `systemctl --user disable lesysbot && rm ~/.config/systemd/user/lesysbot.service && systemctl --user daemon-reload` |

**macOS (launchd)**

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Is it running? | `launchctl list \| grep lesysbot` |
| Start / stop | `launchctl start com.lesysbot.lesysbot` / `stop com.lesysbot.lesysbot` |
| Apply config changes | `launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.lesysbot.lesysbot` |
| Remove it | `launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lesysbot.lesysbot.plist && rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lesysbot.lesysbot.plist` |

**Windows (Task Scheduler)**

| Action | Command (PowerShell) |
|---|---|
| Is it running? | `Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LeSysBot' \| Select-Object State` |
| Start / stop | `Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LeSysBot'` / `Stop-ScheduledTask …` |
| Remove it | `Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'LeSysBot' -Confirm:$false` |

The graphical Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`) works too — the task is called
**LeSysBot**.

---

## Starting at boot

- **Linux** — the service starts when you log in. To start it before anyone logs
  in (a headless box), run `loginctl enable-linger $USER`. Undo with
  `disable-linger`.
- **macOS** — starts at login automatically. For before-login, the plist has to
  live in `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` and be loaded with `sudo`.
- **Windows** — starts when you log in. For a headless server,
  [NSSM](https://nssm.cc) can register it as a true service.

---

## The message you get when it starts

With Telegram or Slack, LeSysBot messages you as soon as it connects. Since the
service starts at boot, that doubles as a "your machine just came up" ping.

It's a short report — CPU temperature, GPU temperature, disk usage, internet
speed — with each line included only if this machine can answer it. No NVIDIA
driver, no GPU line.

Turn it off or tune it in your config:

```yaml
messaging:
  startup_notice:
    enabled: true
    notify: []          # Telegram chat ids / Slack channel ids
    speedtest: true     # set false to skip the speed measurement
```

Telegram falls back to `allowed_user_ids` when `notify` is empty. Slack has no
equivalent default, so put a channel id there.

---

## Finding the logs

**What the service itself printed:**

```bash
journalctl --user -u lesysbot -f                # Linux, live
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/lesysbot/stderr.log      # macOS
```

Windows: Task Scheduler history, or Event Viewer → Windows Logs → Application.

**What LeSysBot wrote:**

```bash
tail -f ~/.lesysbot/logs/lesysbot.log      # what the program did
tail -f ~/.lesysbot/logs/traces.jsonl      # what the model decided, per message
```

Both rotate daily; see [Settings](configuration.md) to change the level or
switch them off.

---

## Setting one up by hand

You need this if you installed manually, or want something the wizard doesn't
offer. One rule matters more than the rest: **the service must run from the
directory holding your `config.yaml` and `tools/`** — normally `~/.lesysbot`.

Use the `run` subcommand. A bare `lesysbot` in a terminal opens the
[management UI](management-ui.md) instead of the bot.

<details>
<summary><b>Linux — systemd user service</b></summary>

`~/.config/systemd/user/lesysbot.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=LeSysBot — local AI assistant with tools
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=%h/.lesysbot
ExecStart=/home/you/.local/bin/lesysbot run
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Set `ExecStart` from `which lesysbot`, then:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now lesysbot
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>macOS — launchd agent</b></summary>

`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lesysbot.lesysbot.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

</plist>
```

Replace the path with `which lesysbot` and `you` with your username, then:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Logs/lesysbot
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lesysbot.lesysbot.plist
```

## Only one at a time

Two copies of the same Telegram bot would fight over the same messages —
Telegram rejects both with a `409`. So LeSysBot takes a lock per bot token at
startup, and a second one refuses to start, naming the process that holds it.

Stop the service first if you want a foreground run. The lock is released
automatically when the process ends, crashes included, so nothing gets stuck. A
terminal chat (`lesysbot --provider cli`) doesn't poll, so it always runs fine
alongside the service.

## Something's wrong

Service problems — exits immediately, `command not found`, config changes not
taking effect — are covered in
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#running-in-the-background).
