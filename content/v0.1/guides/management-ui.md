title: Management UI
description: Edit settings and toggle, install, or remove tools from a web page that only your machine can reach.
section: Everyday use
source: docs/management-ui.md
---
A small web page for the two things you change most — your **settings** and your
**tools** — plus a status screen that answers "is it working?" at a glance.

It runs on your machine only. Nothing about it is reachable from your network.

---

## Opening it

Run `lesysbot` with no arguments in a terminal:

```bash
lesysbot
```

```
[the LeSysBot mark, in colour]  LeSysBot
                                v0.1.0

  LLM backend  reachable · 42 ms
     Provider  cli · model llama3.2
        Tools  12/13 enabled
  Bot service  running (PID 12934)
      Grafana  http://localhost:3001 · v11.5.1
       Config  /home/you/.lesysbot/config.yaml

  Management UI: http://127.0.0.1:8700   (localhost only · Ctrl-C to stop)
```

The mark is drawn in colour when your terminal supports it. It disappears on its
own under `NO_COLOR`, a plain `TERM`, or when you pipe the output somewhere —
so `lesysbot > status.txt` stays readable.

Ctrl-C stops it. A few variations:

```bash
lesysbot manage             # the same thing, said explicitly
lesysbot manage --open      # and open it in your browser
lesysbot manage --port 9000 # if 8700 is taken
```

> **Looking for a chat?** Bare `lesysbot` opens this UI, not a conversation. Use
> `lesysbot --provider cli` to chat, or `lesysbot run` to run the bot in the
> foreground. The background service uses `lesysbot run` already — nothing to
> change there.

## What you can do with it

**Status** — whether your model backend is reachable and how fast it answers,
which provider and model are active, how many tools are on, whether the
background bot service is running, a link to your
[Grafana dashboard](../monitoring/README.md) if the monitoring stack is up, and
where your config and tools actually live.

**Tools** — every tool with its current state:

- **Enable / disable** with one click, applied to a running bot within a second.
- **Install** a package from GitHub by pasting `owner/repo`.
- **Remove** a package, files and all.

**Settings** — your `config.yaml` in an editor. Saving checks it first and
refuses to write something invalid, so you can't lock yourself out with a typo.
Most settings take effect the next time the bot starts; tool enable/disable is
the exception and applies immediately.

## Is this safe to leave running?

Yes, on a machine only you use — that's the assumption it's built on.

- **It's localhost-only.** The server binds `127.0.0.1`. The host isn't
  configurable, only the port, so it can't accidentally end up on your LAN. It
  also rejects any request whose `Host` header isn't localhost, which blocks a
  malicious web page from reaching it through your browser.
- **There's no login.** Anyone who can open `http://127.0.0.1:8700` on the
  machine can use it — but they could equally just edit `config.yaml`. That's
  the trust boundary, and it's the same one.
- **It shows your secrets**, because it shows your real config file. If that
  bothers you, keep tokens in environment variables and reference them as
  `${VAR}` — see [Settings](configuration.md).

Don't forward the port or put it behind a reverse proxy unless you add
authentication and TLS yourself.

The bot process itself still opens no listener at all. This UI is a separate
server you start on purpose.

## Settings

Only the port:

```yaml
webui:
  port: 8700
```
